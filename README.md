Haskell and Functional Programming course for complete beginners.

> 👩‍🏫 The course was created in 2022 but it's still active and
> constantly improving.

Course learning materials comprises:

* [🎥 Four 1-hour lectures on YouTube][video]
* [🖼 Slides][slides]
* [🧩 Practical exercises and Haskell intallation instructions][exercises]

[video]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MsQcUprO9o&list=PLOJjn67NeYg9cWA4hyIWcxfaeX64pwo1c&ab_channel=chshersh
[slides]: https://slides.com/haskellbeginners2022
[exercises]: https://github.com/haskell-beginners-2022/exercises

The course is entirely free and includes one particularly interesting feature:

+ 🆙 **Review of your solutions to exercises!**

You can solve exercises, and I'm (Dmitrii Kovanikov) going to provide
review to your solutions, suggesting improvements and alternative ways
to solve tasks using idiomatic FP.

Below you can find the plan of each individual lecture with the
corresponding links to learning materials.
